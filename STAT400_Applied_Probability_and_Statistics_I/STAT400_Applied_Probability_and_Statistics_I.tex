\section*{Lecture 1: Tuesday 8/27/2024}

\section*{Course Overview: STAT400}
We study:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Probability
    \item Descriptive Statistics
    \item Inferential Statistics
\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak

\subsection*{1. Probability}
\textit{Probability} is the mathematical study of uncertainty.

\subsection*{2. Descriptive Statistics}
\textit{Descriptive Statistics} involves methods for summarizing and describing the important characteristics of a dataset.

\subsection*{3. Inferential Statistics}
\textit{Inferential Statistics} involves methods for using data from a subset (sample) of a larger group (population) to make meaningful conclusions. Note that each time you pick a subset, you lose out on certain information, leading to uncertainty.

\subsection*{Setting: Conducting an Experiment}

In this course, we will often assume we are about to conduct an experiment. The possible outcomes of the experiment are known, but the exact outcome is not.

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tossing a coin
    \item Rolling a die
\end{itemize}

To study these types of situations, we introduce a \textit{model for probability}.

\subsection*{Ordered Triples (\(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P\))}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\Omega\) is the \textbf{sample space}: The set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
    \item \(\mathcal{F}\) is the \textbf{event space}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An \textbf{event} is a subset of \(\Omega\).
        \item An event captures the idea that in many situations, we care about collections of outcomes rather than a single outcome.
        \item The event space contains collections of outcomes for which we can assign probabilities.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \(P\) is the \textbf{probability measure}:
    \[
    P: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
    \]
    where \(P\) assigns probabilities to events.

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\subsection*{Example 1: Tossing a Fair Coin}
Consider the simple experiment of tossing a \textbf{fair} coin.

\[
\Omega = \{H, T\}
\]

\[
\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H, T\}\}
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P(\emptyset) = 0\) \\
    (``A probability of 0 represents an outcome/collection of outcomes that never takes place.")
    
    \item \(P(\{H, T\}) = 1\) \\
    (``A probability of 1 represents an outcome/collection of outcomes that always takes place.")
    
    \item \(P(\{H\}) = \frac{1}{2}\) \\
    (Requires the coin to be fair.)
    
    \item \(P(\{T\}) = \frac{1}{2}\) \\
    (Requires the coin to be fair.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example 2: Rolling a Fair Die}
Consider the experiment of rolling a fair die. Note: (\(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\) is the Powerset of \(\Omega\))

\[
\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
\]

\[
\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}(\Omega) =
\]
\[
\begin{aligned}
\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \ldots, \{6\}, \{1, 2\}, \ldots, \{1, 6\}, \{2, 3\}, \ldots, \\
\{1, 2, 3\}, \{2, 3, 4\}, \ldots, \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, \ldots, \Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P(\{i\}) = \frac{1}{6}\) for \(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\)
    \item \(P(\emptyset) = 0\)
    \item \(P(\Omega) = 1\)
    \item \(P(\{1, 2\}) = ?\) \\
    (Listing out probabilities for each event is \textbf{not} feasible.)
\end{itemize}

We would want a way to calculate the probability of a particular event by using the ``base" probabilities.

\textit{We will look at these rules for computing probabilities of complicated events in terms of basic ones in a bit.}

\subsection*{Example 3: Tossing a Fair Coin Until We See Heads for the First Time}
Consider the experiment of tossing a fair coin repeatedly until we observe heads for the first time, then we stop.

\[
\Omega = \{(H), (T, H), (T, T, H), (T, T, T, H), \ldots\}
\]

\[
\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)
\]

Let \(A_i\) be the event of seeing heads on the \(i\)th toss.

\[
P(A_i) = \frac{1}{2^i}
\]

\textbf{Question:} What is the probability of seeing heads on an even-numbered toss?

\[
Q = P(\text{seeing heads on an even-numbered toss}) = ?
\]

\subsection*{Example 4: Picking a Number from the Interval [0, 1]}
Consider picking a number from the interval \([0, 1]\) such that the probabilities of selecting numbers from two subintervals \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) of \([0, 1]\) are the same whenever \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) have the same length.

\[
\Omega = [0, 1]
\]

\[
\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)
\]

\[
P(\text{selecting a number from a subinterval } I \text{ of } [0, 1]) = \text{length}(I)
\]

\[
P([0, \frac{1}{4}]) = \frac{1}{4} - 0 = \frac{1}{4}
\]

\[
P([0, \frac{1}{2}]) = \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
P\left(\left\{\frac{1}{2}\right\}\right) = P\left(\left[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right]\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0
\]

``The probability of 0 indicates an event that does not take place or an event that is so unlikely that the only reasonable value to assign to it is 0, i.e., an event that almost surely does not take place."

On Thursday will learn how to compute problems similar to \(P(\mathbb{Q} \cap [0, 1])\) = ?

\section*{Lecture 2: Thursday 8/29/2024}

\subsection*{Probability}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mathematical study of uncertainty.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Probability Space}

\[
(\Omega, F, P)
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\Omega\) - All possible outcomes of the experiment of interest.
    \item \(F\) - Contains events, i.e., collections of outcomes we would like to assign probabilities to.
    \item \(P\) - Probability measure.
\end{itemize}

\[
P: F \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\]

On Tuesday, we discussed examples and introduced some formulas to compute probabilities of ``basic" events.

\subsection*{Goal for Today}

Explore how to compute probabilities of ``complicated" events in terms of basic events.

\subsection*{Two Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do we express a complicated event in terms of basic ones?
    \item What rules can be used to compute probabilities once Question 1 has been answered?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Question 1 is best answered by using tools from set theory.
\end{itemize}

\[
\rightarrow \text{We treat } \Omega \text{ as the list of all possible outcomes.}
\]
\[
\rightarrow \text{Events are sublists of } \Omega.
\]

Since we are only interested in outcomes (or combinations thereof) of the experiment, we treat \(\Omega\) as the universal set (i.e., we pretend that nothing outside of \(\Omega\) exists).

\subsection*{Pictorial Representation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick] (0,0) rectangle (4,2);
    \node at (-0.5,2) {\(\Omega\)};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\pagebreak

We can manipulate collections of events to obtain new events in various ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Intersections
    \item Unions
    \item Relative complements
\end{itemize}

Given events \(A\) and \(B\), the intersection is the event that contains all outcomes common to both \(A\) and \(B\). We denote this by \(A \cap B\).

\subsection*{Intersection of Two Events}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw the rectangle representing the universal set Omega
    \draw[thick] (-2,-2) rectangle (4,2);
    \node at (-2.5,1.8) {\(\Omega\)};
    
    % Draw the circles representing sets A and B
    \begin{scope}
        \clip (0,0) circle(1.5);
        \fill[gray!30] (2,0) circle(1.5);
    \end{scope}
    \draw (0,0) circle(1.5);
    \draw (2,0) circle(1.5);
    
    % Label the sets
    \node at (-0.8,1.5) {\(A\)};
    \node at (2.8,1.5) {\(B\)};
    
    % Label the intersection area
    \node at (1,0) {\(A \cap B\)};
    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Example}

\[
\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
\]

Let \(A = \{1, 3, 5\}\) and \(B = \{4, 5\}\). Then, the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\) is:

\[
A \cap B = \{5\}
\]

\subsection*{Extending the Intersection to Families of Events}

The idea of the intersection of events can be extended to families of events.

\[
\bigcap_{i=1}^{3} A_i = (A_1 \cap A_2) \cap A_3
\]

For an infinite family of events:

\[
\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4 \cap A_5 \cap \ldots
\]


\subsection*{Disjoint Events}

Two events are said to be disjoint if \(A \cap B = \emptyset\).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Events \(A_1, \ldots, A_n\) are said to be disjoint if \(\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i = \emptyset \).

    \item Events \(A_1, \ldots, A_n, \ldots\) are said to be disjoint if \(\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i = \emptyset \).
 
    \item Events \(A_1, A_2, \ldots\) are said to be pairwise disjoint if \(A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset\) for all \(i \neq j\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example}

Consider the sample space \(\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) with the following events:

\[
A = \{1, 3, 5\}, \quad B = \{4, 5\}, \quad C = \{6\}
\]

Here, \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are disjoint events, meaning:

\[
A \cap B \cap C = \emptyset
\]

However, they are not pairwise disjoint, because:

\[
A \cap B = \{5\} \neq \emptyset
\]

\subsection*{Pairwise Disjoint Sets}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

    % Draw the rectangle representing the universal set Omega
    \draw[thick] (-2,-2) rectangle (4,2);
    \node at (-2.5,1.8) {\(\Omega\)};
    
    % Draw non-intersecting circles representing pairwise disjoint sets
    \draw (0,0.5) circle(0.4);
    \draw (2,0.5) circle(0.4);
    \draw (1,-1) circle(0.4);
    
    % Label the sets
    \node at (-0.5,1.2) {\(A\)};
    \node at (2.5,1.2) {\(B\)};
    \node at (1,-1.7) {\(C\)};
    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


The word ``and" usually translates to intersection when discussing sets or events. Conversely, the word ``or" translates to a union.

\subsection*{Unions}

The union of two events \(A\) and \(B\), denoted by \(A \cup B\), is the event that contains all outcomes that are in \(A\), \(B\), or both.

\subsection*{Venn Diagram: Union of Two Sets}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

    % Draw the rectangle representing the universal set Omega
    \draw[thick] (-2,-2) rectangle (4,2);
    \node at (-2.5,1.8) {\(\Omega\)};
    
    % Draw the circles representing sets A and B
    \begin{scope}
        \clip (0,0) circle(1.5);
        \fill[gray!30] (2,0) circle(1.5);
    \end{scope}
    \fill[gray!30] (0,0) circle(1.5);
    \fill[gray!30] (2,0) circle(1.5);
    \draw (0,0) circle(1.5);
    \draw (2,0) circle(1.5);
    
    % Label the sets
    \node at (-0.8,1.5) {\(A\)};
    \node at (2.8,1.5) {\(B\)};
    \node at (1,-2.5) {\(A \cup B\) (shaded region)};
    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Example}

Consider the sample space \(\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) with the following events:

\[
A = \{1, 3, 5\}, \quad B = \{2, 3, 5\}
\]

The union of \(A\) and \(B\) is:

\[
A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 5\}
\]


\subsection*{Infinite and Finite Unions}

Infinite versions of unions and finite versions of unions with more than two sets can be similarly defined.

\[
\bigcup_{i=1}^{3} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3
\]

Similarly, the union of more than two finite sets can be defined as:

\[
\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots \cup A_n
\]

Unions can also be extended to infinite collections of sets. For example, the union of an infinite sequence of sets \(A_1, A_2, \ldots\) is denoted as:

\[
\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots
\]



\subsection*{Relative Complements}

Given events \(A\) and \(B\), the relative complement \(A - B\) is the event that contains only the outcomes that are \textbf{unique} to \(A\).

\subsection*{Venn Diagram: Unique to A (\(A - B\))}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

    % Draw the rectangle representing the universal set Omega
    \draw[thick] (-2,-2) rectangle (4,2);
    \node at (-2.5,1.8) {\(\Omega\)};
    
    % Draw the circles representing sets A and B
    \fill[gray!30] (0,0) circle(1.5);
    \begin{scope}
        \clip (2,0) circle(1.5);
        \fill[white] (0,0) circle(1.5);
    \end{scope}
    \draw (0,0) circle(1.5);
    \draw (2,0) circle(1.5);
    
    % Label the sets
    \node at (-0.8,1.5) {\(A\)};
    \node at (2.8,1.5) {\(B\)};
    \node at (-0.5,0) {\(A - B\)};
    
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Example}

Consider the sample space \(\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) with the following events:

\[
A = \{1, 2, 3\}, \quad B = \{2, 4, 5\}
\]

The relative complements are:

\[
A - B = \{1, 3\}, \quad B - A = \{4, 5\}
\]


\subsection*{Complement of A}

We use \(A^c\) to denote the complement of \(A\) within the universal set \(\Omega\), which is the set of outcomes that are not in \(A\):

\[
A^c = \Omega - A = \{4, 5, 6\}
\]

The word \textbf{not} is associated with complements and the phrases ``and not", ``but not" are associated with relative compliments

\subsection*{Aside (for the HW): Verifying Set Identities with Venn Diagrams}

We can use Venn diagrams to verify set identities. For example, let's verify the identity:

\[
(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c
\]

Venn diagrams representing set operations of (left hand side) LHS and (right hand side) RHS respectively are shown below:

\subsubsection*{Conclusion}

Both sides of the identity are visually represented by the same shaded region, thus confirming that:

\[
(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c
\]


The shaded regions for \((A \cap B)^c\) and \(A^c \cup B^c\) match. Therefore, \((A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c\). 

\[\]

\textbf{Note}: (we are not worrying about edges cases, for example, where A and B are disjoint but the identity still holds true)

\[\]
Now that the terminology is in place, we start to answer Q2.

\section*{Axioms}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(P(\Omega) = 1\), \(P(\emptyset) = 0\)
    \item \(P(A) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } A \in \mathcal{F}\)
    \item If \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n, \ldots \in \mathcal{F}\) are pairwise disjoint, then 
    \[
    P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)
    \]
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Example:}
Consider the problem of tossing a fair coin until we observe heads. We want to find P(heads on an even numbered toss)

Let \( A \) be the event that heads appears for the first time on an even-numbered toss.

Thus, \( A \) can be expressed as:
\[
A = \{ (T, H), (T, T, T, H), (T, T, T, T, T, H), \dots \}
\]

Recall, $A_i$ is heads on the ith toss.


\[
P(A_i) = \frac{1}{2^i}
\]


Notice that we can describe \( A \) as the union of disjoint events where heads occurs for the first time on the \( 2i \)-th toss:

\[
A = A_2 \cup A_4 \cup A_6 \cup \dots = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{2i}
\]

where \( A_{2i} \) is the event that heads first appears on the \( 2i \)-th toss. The probability of \( A_{2i} \) can be computed as:
\[
P(A_{2i}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2i}
\]

Since the events \( A_{2i} \) are pairwise disjoint, we can use axiom 3 to see the probability of \( A \) is given by:
\[
P(A) = P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{2i}\right)
= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_{2i}) 
= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2i} = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{i}
\]
This series is an infinite geometric series with the first term \( a = \frac{1}{4} \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{4} \): 

Recall, that a the sum of a converging infinite geometric series where \(|r| < 1\) is:
\[
S = a+ar+ar^2+... = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left(ar^n\right) = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^i = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability that the first occurrence of heads is on an even-numbered toss is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{3}} \).


Derived rule: If \( A_1, \dots, A_N \in \mathcal{F} \) are pairwise disjoint, then 
\[
P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)
\]

\textbf{Example}: Consider a fair die roll. What is the probability of rolling a 1, 3, or 5?

\[
P(\{i\}) = \frac{1}{6} \quad \text{for } i = 1, \dots, 6
\]

\[
P(\{1, 3, 5\}) = P(\{1\}) + P(\{3\}) + P(\{5\}) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

\section{Probability}

\textbf{Definition:} Probability is the mathematical framework for quantifying and analyzing uncertainty.

A probability space is defined by the triple \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \), where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \Omega \) is the sample space (set of all possible outcomes)
    \item \( \mathcal{F} \) is the event space (sigma-algebra of subsets of \( \Omega \))
    \item \( P \) is the probability measure (function assigning probabilities to events)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Axioms of Probability}

The probability measure \( P \) satisfies the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( P(\Omega) = 1 \) and \( P(\emptyset) = 0 \)
    \item For all \( A \in \mathcal{F} \), \( P(A) \geq 0 \)
    \item (Countable additivity) If \(A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{F}\) are pairwise disjoint events (i.e $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$):
        \[
        P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)
        \]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Understanding and being able to derive properties from these axioms is crucial for the first midterm and for building a solid foundation in probability theory.

\subsection*{Important Results}

\begin{enumerate}  
    \item \textbf{Decomposition of Probability:} For any two events \(A, B \in \mathcal{F}\):
    \[
        P(B) = P(B - A) + P(A \cap B)
    \]

    \textit{Proof:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Observe that \(B\) can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: \(B = (B - A) \cup (A \cap B)\)
        \item Note that \((B - A) \cap (A \cap B) = \emptyset\) (these sets are mutually exclusive)
        \item By the axiom of countable additivity (which implies finite additivity for disjoint events):
        \[P(B) = P((B - A) \cup (A \cap B)) = P(B - A) + P(A \cap B)\]
    \end{itemize}

    This result is fundamental in probability theory and is often used in solving complex probability problems. 
    It allows us to break down the probability of an event into mutually exclusive parts, which can be easier to calculate individually.

    \item \textbf{Finite Additivity:} For any two events \(A, B \in \mathcal{F}\):
    \[
        P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
    \]

    \textit{Proof:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Observe that \(A \cup B = A \cup (B - A)\) and \(A \cap (B - A) = \emptyset\)
        \item Since \(A\) and \(B - A\) are disjoint, \(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B - A)\) (finite additivity)
        \item From the decomposition result: \(P(B) = P(B - A) + P(A \cap B)\)
        \item Rearranging: \(P(B - A) = P(B) - P(A \cap B)\)
        \item Substituting into our earlier equation:
              \[P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\]

        \node at (2.5,0) {\(B - A\)};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    
    \item \textbf{Monotonicity:} If \(A \subseteq B\), then \(P(A) \leq P(B)\)
    
    \textit{Proof:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \(A \subseteq B\), then:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \(B = A \cup (B - A)\)
                \item \(A \cap (B - A) = \emptyset\)
            \end{itemize}
        \item By finite additivity: \(P(B) = P(A \cup (B - A)) = P(A) + P(B - A)\)
        \item Since probabilities are non-negative, \(P(B - A) \geq 0\)
        \item Therefore, \(P(B) \geq P(A)\)
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Union of Three Sets:} For \(A, B, C \in \mathcal{F}\):
    \[
    P(A \cup B \cup C)
    \]

    \textit{How to compute:}
    \begin{align*}
        P(A \cup B \cup C) &= P(A) + P(B \cup C) - P(A \cap (B \cup C)) \\
        &= P(A) + [P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C)] - P(A \cap (B \cup C)) \quad \text{(decompose the union)} \\
        &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C) - P((A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)) \quad \text{(by distributive law)} \\
        &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C) - (P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap C) - P((A \cap B) \cap (A \cap C)))  \\
        &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C) - (P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap C) - P(A \cap B \cap C))  \\
        &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)  \\

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example:} Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are events with $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(B) = 0.6$. Find numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \leq P(A \cup B) \leq b$ and $a \leq P(A \cap B) \leq b$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using the addition rule of probability:
        \[P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.5 + 0.6 - P(A \cap B) = 1.1 - P(A \cap B)\]
    
    \item Since $A \cup B \subseteq \Omega$ and $P(\Omega) = 1$, we have:
        \[P(A \cup B) \leq P(\Omega) \leq 1\]
    
    \item From steps 1 and 2:
        \[1.1 - P(A \cap B) \leq 1 \implies P(A \cap B) \geq 0.1\]
    
    \item The maximum value for $P(A \cap B)$ is $\min(P(A), P(B)) = 0.5$, because:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $A \cap B \subseteq A$ and $A \cap B \subseteq B$
            \item Therefore, $P(A \cap B) \leq P(A)$ and $P(A \cap B) \leq P(B)$
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item We can conclude:
        \[0.1 \leq P(A \cap B) \leq 0.5\]
        \[0.6 \leq P(A \cup B) \leq 1.0\]
    
    \item To verify the lower bound for $P(A \cup B)$:
        \begin{align*}
            P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\
                        &\geq P(A) + P(B) - \min(P(A), P(B)) \\
                        &= 0.5 + 0.6 - 0.5 = 0.6
        \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Conclusion:} We have found that $a = 0.1$ and $b = 0.5$ satisfy $a \leq P(A \cap B) \leq b$, while $a = 0.6$ and $b = 1.0$ satisfy $a \leq P(A \cup B) \leq b$.

\textbf{Visualization:} To better understand the relationship between $A$ and $B$, consider the following Venn diagram:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw the rectangle representing the universal set Omega
    \draw[thick] (-3,-2) rectangle (3,2);
    
    % Draw the circles representing sets A and B
    \begin{scope}
        \clip (-0.5,0) circle(1.5);
        \fill[gray!30] (0.5,0) circle(1.5);
    \end{scope}
    \draw (-0.5,0) circle(1.5);
    \draw (0.5,0) circle(1.5);
    
    % Label the sets
    \node at (-2.2,1) {$A$};
    \node at (2.2,1) {$B$};
    \node at (0, 0) {$A \cap B$};
    
    % Add probabilities

    \node at (1.5,-1.7) {$P(B) = 0.6$};
    \node at (0,1.75) {$0.1 \leq P(A \cap B) \leq 0.5$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This visualization illustrates why $0.1 \leq P(A \cap B) \leq 0.5$ and $0.6 \leq P(A \cup B) \leq 1.0$.



\textbf{Example:} When Alice visits a certain grocery store, she:
\begin{itemize}
    \item buys apples with probability 0.4
    \item buys bananas with probability 0.7
    \item buys both with probability 0.25
\end{itemize}

Compute the probability that on her next visit to the store, Alice:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item buys either apples or bananas
    \item buys bananas but not apples
    \item buys neither apples nor bananas
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 1:} Define notation and given probabilities
\begin{align*}
    A &: \text{Alice buys apples} \\
    B &: \text{Alice buys bananas}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    P(A) &= 0.4 \\
    P(B) &= 0.7 \\
    P(A \cap B) &= 0.25
\end{align*}

\textbf{Note:} Symbol correspondences
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\cup$ corresponds to ``or" (union)
    \item $\cap$ corresponds to ``and" (intersection)
    \item $\complement$ corresponds to ``not" (complement)
    \item $-$ corresponds to ``and not", or ``but not" (relative complement)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 2:} Calculate probabilities
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.4 + 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.85$
    \item $P(B - A) = P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.45$
    \item $P(A^c \cap B^c) = P((A \cup B)^c) = 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$
    
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Important probability relationships:
\begin{align*}
    P(A) &= 1 - P(A^c) \\
    \Omega &= A \cup A^c \\
    P(\Omega) &= P(A) + P(A^c) = 1 \\
    P(A^c) &= 1 - P(A)
\end{align*}

\textbf{Computing probabilities for finite, equally likely outcomes:}
For any event $A \subseteq \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is a finite sample space with equally likely outcomes, the probability of $A$ is given by:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{number of elements in } A}{\text{number of elements in } \Omega} = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}
\]

where $|A|$ denotes the cardinality (number of elements) of set $A$.

\section*{Lecture 4: Thursday 9/5/2024}

\subsection*{Probability for Finite, Equally Likely Outcomes}

Consider an experiment with finitely many outcomes, each of which is equally likely. This scenario is often referred to as ``fair" or ``uniformly at random" (with finite outcomes).

In this situation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$
    \item For any event $A \in \mathcal{F}$, $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proof that $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$ satisfies the axioms of probability:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For any outcome $\omega \in \Omega$, we show $P(\{\omega\}) = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}$
    
    Let $\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_n\}$. Then:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P(\{\omega_1\}) = P(\{\omega_2\}) = \cdots = P(\{\omega_n\})$ (equally likely)
        \item $\{\omega_i\}$ are pairwise disjoint for $i = 1, \ldots, n$
        \item $\Omega = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \{\omega_i\}$
        \item $P(\Omega) = P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \{\omega_i\}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(\{\omega_i\})$ (finite additivity)
    \end{itemize}
    Let $x = P(\{\omega_i\})$ for any $i$. Then:
    \begin{align*}
        1 &= P(\Omega) = nx \\
        x &= \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, $P(\{\omega_1\}) = P(\{\omega_2\}) = \cdots = P(\{\omega_n\}) = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}$

    \item For any event $A \subseteq \Omega$, we prove $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$
    
    Let $A = \{\omega_{i_1}, \omega_{i_2}, \ldots, \omega_{i_k}\}$ where $k = |A|$. Then:
    \begin{align*}
        P(A) &= P(\{\omega_{i_1}\} \cup \{\omega_{i_2}\} \cup \cdots \cup \{\omega_{i_k}\}) \\
             &= \sum_{j=1}^{k} P(\{\omega_{i_j}\}) \quad \text{(finite additivity)} \\
             &= \sum_{j=1}^{k} \frac{1}{n} \\
             &= \frac{k}{n} = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}


To properly use the probability formula, we need to be able to count effectively. There are two fundamental principles of counting:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Additive principle of counting
    \item Multiplicative principle of counting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additive Principle of Counting:} If we have $n$ ways of doing one thing and $m$ ways of doing another thing, where both actions cannot be performed simultaneously, then there are $n + m$ ways of selecting an action.

\textbf{Example (Additive Principle):}
Suppose you own:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 6 pairs of jeans
    \item 5 pairs of slacks
\end{itemize}
Then there are $6 + 5 = 11$ ways of selecting an article of clothing.

\textbf{Multiplicative Principle of Counting:} If we have $n$ ways of doing one thing and $m$ ways of doing another thing, then there are $n \times m$ ways of performing both actions.

\textbf{Example (Multiplicative Principle):}
Continuing from the previous example, if you are packing for a trip and want to pack:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 pair of jeans
    \item 1 pair of slacks
\end{itemize}
There are $6 \times 5 = 30$ ways of selecting a pair of jeans and a pair of slacks.

Problems we study in this class can be categorized according to two main features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Replacement
    \item Order
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Passwords: Replacement allowed, order matters
    \item Card games: Usually no replacement, order may or may not matter (depends on the situation)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We can visualize these categories in a 2x2 grid:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    & \textbf{Replacement} & \textbf{No Replacement} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Order Matters} & \checkmark & \checkmark \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Order Doesn't Matter} & $\times$ & \checkmark \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
This grid helps us classify different probability problems based on their characteristics.
The $\checkmark$ and $\times$ are used to indicate what we will study in this class.


\textbf{Problem:} Suppose that a password consists of 10 characters. The character set contains 256 possible characters. If characters are chosen uniformly at random, what is the probability of picking a password that starts with an `A'?

\textbf{Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Replacement: \checkmark
    \item Order matters: \checkmark
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Visualization:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All possible passwords: 
        \[256, 256, 256, \ldots, 256\]
        \[\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\]
        (256 choices for each of the 10 slots)
    \item Passwords starting with 'A':
        \[A, 256, 256, \ldots, 256\]
        \[A\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\]
        (1 choice for first slot (`A'), 256 choices for each of the remaining 9 slots)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calculation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total number of possible passwords: $256^{10}$ (256 choices for each of 10 slots)
    \item Number of passwords starting with `A': $1 \times 256^9$ (1 choice for first slot, 256 choices for each of 9 slots)
    \item Probability = $\frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{1 \times 256^9}{256^{10}} = \frac{1}{256}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} The probability of picking a password that starts with an `A' is $\frac{1}{256}$.

\noindent
\textbf{General Rule:} If you have a list of $n$ things to choose from, replacement is allowed, order matters, and you choose $k$ times, then there are $n^k$ possible choices.

\noindent
\textbf{New Problem:} Using the previous example (where $n = 256$ and $k = 10$), what is the probability of randomly picking a password that repeats at least one character?

\vspace{0.3cm}

\noindent
\textbf{Strategy:} It is sometimes easier to calculate the probability of the complement of an event.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\noindent
\textbf{Approach:} We will count the number of passwords where each character is unique.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\noindent
Let $A$ be the event that the randomly chosen password has no repeated characters.

$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$


\textbf{Number of passwords with unique characters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualization:
        \[\underbrace{256 \cdot 255 \cdot 254 \cdot 253 \cdot 252 \cdot 251 \cdot 250 \cdot 249 \cdot 248 \cdot 247}_{10\text{ positions}}\]
    \item Mathematical representation: $\prod_{i=0}^{9} (256 - i)$
    \item Probability calculation: $P(A^c) = 1 - \frac{\prod_{i=0}^{9} (256 - i)}{256^{10}}$
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{General Formula:} When picking $k$ things out of $n$ things while keeping track of the order (where $k \leq n$):

\vspace{0.3cm}

\noindent
Number of different ways:
\begin{align*}
    &= n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1) \\
    &= n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1) \cdot \frac{(n-k) \cdot (n-k-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot 1}{(n-k) \cdot (n-k-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot 1} \\
    &= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
\end{align*}

Where $n!$ is defined as:
\[
    n! = \prod_{i=1}^{n} i \quad \text{and} \quad 0! = 1
\]

\vspace{0.3cm}

\noindent
$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ is known as ``$n$ permute $k$", denoted as ${}^nP_k$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
\textbf{No replacement, order does not matter:}

\noindent
The trick is to solve the problem assuming order matters, then adjust by dividing by the number of ways to order the $k$ things.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\noindent
Consider the following slots:

\[
\underbrace{\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_}_{k\text{ slots}}
\]

\noindent
First, we count the number of ways to fill these slots while keeping track of the order:
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is given by ${}^nP_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
    \item It represents the number of ways to choose and arrange $k$ items from $n$ options
\end{itemize}

However, this count includes permutations of the same $k$ items, which we don't want to distinguish. To adjust for this overcounting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We divide by the number of ways to order $k$ items, which is $k!$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $k!$ represents all possible permutations of the $k$ chosen items
        \end{itemize}
    \item This adjustment gives us the following formula:
        \[ \frac{{}^nP_k}{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {}^nC_k \]
\end{itemize}

The result, ${}^nC_k$, is known as ``$n$ choose $k$". It represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from $n$ options when the order doesn't matter.
